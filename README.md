# MongoDB Data Layer Fundamentals and Advanced Techniques

## 📚 Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamentals and advanced techniques of working with MongoDB using Node.js. It covers database setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing for performance optimization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running locally, or a MongoDB Atlas cluster

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
npm install
```

This installs the required dependencies (`mongodb`, `dotenv`, `mongoose`).

### 3. Configure Environment

Edit `.env.txt` to set your MongoDB connection URI if needed:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/plp_bookstore
```

### 4. Populate the Database

Run the following command to insert sample book data into the `plp_bookstore` database:

```sh
node insert_books.js
```

This script will:
- Connect to MongoDB
- Drop the existing `books` collection if it exists
- Insert a set of sample book documents

### 5. Run Queries and Aggregations

Execute all required queries and aggregations:

```sh
node queries.js
```

This script will:
- Perform CRUD operations (find, update, delete)
- Run advanced queries (filtering, projection, sorting, pagination)
- Execute aggregation pipelines (average price by genre, top author, books by decade)
- Create indexes and demonstrate their effect using `explain()`

## 📝 Scripts

### [`insert_books.js`](insert_books.js)

Populates the `books` collection with sample data.  
**Usage:**  
```sh
node insert_books.js
```

### [`queries.js`](queries.js)

Contains all required MongoDB queries, aggregations, and indexing operations.  
**Usage:**  
```sh
node queries.js
```

### [`db.js`](db.js)

Exports a helper function to connect to the MongoDB database and access the `books` collection.

## 🧪 Example Output

- Lists of books by genre, author, and publication year
- Aggregated statistics (average price by genre, top author, books by decade)
- Index creation logs and explain plan output

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you see `Error: Cannot find module 'mongodb'`, run:

```sh
npm install
```

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update `.env.txt` with your Atlas URI.

## 📸 Submission

- Ensure your repository contains:
  - `insert_books.js`
  - `queries.js`
  - `README.md` (this file)
  - Screenshot of your MongoDB Compass or Atlas showing your collections and sample data
